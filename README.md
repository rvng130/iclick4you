# iclick4you

My professor made iclicker questions required for participation, however 
if there was ever a reason I'd need to skip class, I'd solve the iclicker questions that my prof had
put on the shared powerpoint the night before, then manually change the code to reflect the answers in order.
Then what the program does is take a screenshot every 30 seconds, compare it to the last screenshot to see if its a new question, then move the mouse and click on the right answer. 

It's only optimized on my computer layout as it's a very niche program and I didn't use it many times to justify streamlining the process better. 
(On my mac, open up iclicker on a browser and put it all the way to the left of the screen, then run the program)
